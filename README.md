**Description** A project management tool specifically geared towards game development. Draws heavy inspiration from the likes of other available tools such as *Trello*, *Hack n Plan* and *Taiga*.

**Motivation** Just a pet project to learn some front-end and back-end stuff. Will probably serve as a demonstration of what I've learnt to others interested and for *myself*.

## Features
### Current
- **This list will update when a feature is implemented**
### Upcoming/Planned
- Kanban-style boards with *categories* (filter out tasks based on one or more categories)
- User Dashboard (a view-all type page listing your group(s) and projects currently in development or finished)
### Other Ideas
- Integrate a Game Design Document (GDD) page where an individual or group can view in their browser

## Tools and Technologies
**Front-end**
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

**Back-end**
- PHP
- MySQL
- Apache

## Acknowledgments
- To my current **boss**, whose excitement for developing small tools to improve workflow has enabled me to appreciate developing tools to help make project development easier. Also, his firm belief that if you can build something that already exists then you're better off doing so in the long run.
- As previously mentioned, applications like Trello, Hack n Plan and Taiga for managing projects.
